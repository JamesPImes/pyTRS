    "The following limitations are IN ADDITION TO the full disclaimer set "

    "USE THIS PROGRAM AND ASSOCIATED PROGRAMS (the \"Software\") AT YOUR OWN "
    "RISK. It is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express "
    "or implied, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF "
    "MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. "
    "IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER "
    "LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING "
    "FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER "
    "DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n"

    "Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following should "
    "also be considered:\n\n"

    "Results may NOT be used in any legal documents. This is intended for "
    "general data-analysis purposes ONLY!\n\n"

    "All results should be proofread by the user to ensure fidelity, due to "
    "flaws, typos, and non-standardized abbreviations and formatting in the "
    "input data, and possible bugs or limitations in the Software itself.\n\n"
    
    "The Software is able to account for many typos/abbreviations and "
    "formatting differences. However, even if the input data is 'correctly' "
    "formatted (i.e. accurately describes the correct lands), the Software "
    "may NOT capture every edge case.\n\n"
    
    "The Software can generate warning flags and error flags for the user's "
    "review (although depending on the specific implementation, the end user "
    "may not have access to such flags). Regardless, the absence of such a "
    "flag or flags is not conclusive proof that the output is correct and "
    "should not be construed as such. Generally speaking, the cleaner and "
    "more standard the input data, the better the output data.\n\n"

    "Finally, note that all of the example PLSS descriptions used in the "
    "comments in the code and documentation are dummy data and were invented "
    "or arbitrarily chosen. (Some are even nonsense.)"
