# Guide to `Tract` objects

A `Tract` object represents land lying within a single, specific Twp/Rge/Sec. It can optionally parse the description of that land into lots and aliquots, stored in its `.lots`, `.qqs`, and `.lots_qqs` attributes.


## Table of Contents

1) `Tract` attributes -- i.e. parsed data (see [the table in this guide](https://github.com/JamesPImes/pyTRS/blob/master/guides/guides/tract_attributes.md#tract-attribute-table))

2) Extracting data from `Tract` objects in bulk (see [this guide](https://github.com/JamesPImes/pyTRS/blob/master/guides/guides/tract.md#extracting-data-in-bulk-from-a-tract-object))

3) `Tract` objects [created by `PLSSDesc` objects](https://github.com/JamesPImes/pyTRS/blob/master/guides/guides/tract.md#tract-objects-created-from-parsing-a-plssdesc) (i.e. parsing a raw PLSS land description)

4) `Tract` objects [created directly](https://github.com/JamesPImes/pyTRS/blob/master/guides/guides/tract.md#creating-tract-objects-directly).

5) Populating the [lists of lots and aliquots](https://github.com/JamesPImes/pyTRS/blob/master/guides/guides/tract.md#populating-lotsaliquots).


## `Tract` attributes

See [the table here](https://github.com/JamesPImes/pyTRS/blob/master/guides/guides/tract_attributes.md#tract-attribute-table) for all `Tract` attributes -- i.e. the meaningful data generated by the parsers.


## Extracting data in bulk from a `Tract` object

[See the guide on extracting `Tract` data in bulk.](https://github.com/JamesPImes/pyTRS/blob/master/guides/guides/extracting_data.md)


## `Tract` objects created from parsing a `PLSSDesc`

When a `PLSSDesc` object is parsed, it automatically creates `Tract` objects and stores them in the `.tracts` attribute (specifically, a `pytrs.TractList` object that holds the tracts).

```
parsed_plssdesc = pytrs.PLSSDesc("T154N-R97W Sec 14: NE/4")

# The resulting Tract objects are stored in `.tracts` of the PLSSDesc.
for tract in parsed_plssdesc.tracts:
    print(tract.trs)
```


## Creating `Tract` objects directly

When creating a `Tract` object directly, specifying the `trs` is optional; and populating `lots`, `qqs`, `lots_qqs`, and `lot_acres` attributes is also optional (parsing is turned on with `parse_qq=True` and [optionally configured with `config=`](https://github.com/JamesPImes/pyTRS/blob/master/guides/guides/config.md)).
```
# Optional parameter `parse_qq=True`.
tract_object = pytrs.Tract(
    "NE/4", trs="154n97w14", parse_qq=True, config='clean_qq, qq_depth_min.3')
```

#### Create `Tract` objects with uncompiled Twp/Rge/Sec components with `Tract.from_twprgesec()`

To create a `Tract` without first compiling the Twp, Rge, and Section components into the pyTRS format, use `Tract.from_twprgesec()` method:

```
tract_object = pytrs.Tract.from_twprgesec(
    "NE/4", twp=154, rge=97, sec=14, default_ns='n', default_ew='w',
    parse_qq=True, config='clean_qq,qq_depth_min.3')
```

|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------:|
|`desc=<str>`           | The description of the land lying within this unit Twp/Rge/Sec       |         |
| `twp=<str or int>`    | The Township, either an int, or a str (e.g., `'154n'`, `'1s'`, etc.) | 1, 5    |
| `rge=<str or int>`    | The Range, either an int, or a str (e.g., `'154n'`, `'1s'`, etc.)    | 1, 5    |
| `sec=<str or int>`    | The Section, either an int, or a str (e.g., `'154n'`, `'1s'`, etc.)  | 1       |
| `default_ns=<'n' or 's'>` | Whether to default Township to North or South                    | 1, 5    |
| `default_ns=<'e' or 'w'>` | Whether to default Range to East or West                         | 1, 5    |
|`config=<str>`         | [Configure the parser with a number of options](https://github.com/JamesPImes/pyTRS/blob/master/guides/guides/config.md)                        | 2       |
|`parse_qq=<bool>`      | Parse this `Tract` object into lots/aliquots               |         |

|`desc_is_flawed=<bool>`| If a fatal flaw was found during parsing of parent `PLSSDesc`        | 4       |

##### `Tract.from_twprgesec()` Footnotes:
1) The [standard pyTRS format for Twp/Rge/Sec](https://github.com/JamesPImes/pyTRS/blob/master/guides/guides/trs.md#standard-pytrs-format-for-twprgesec) is up to 3 digits for Twp (plus `'n'` or `'s'`) and for Rge (plus `'e'` or `'w'`), and exactly two digits for section. (Examples: `Sec 14 of T154N-R97W` -> `'154n97w14'`; and `Sec 1 of T7S-R9E` -> `'7s9e01'`)

2) See [the `config` guide](https://github.com/JamesPImes/pyTRS/blob/master/guides/guides/config.md) for more information on `config=` options.

3) `source` does not affect the behavior of the parse in any way. Instead, it is meant as an internal record of where the description originally came from. (For example, if it came from a particular report, or a specific row in a spreadsheet, etc.)  If a `Tract` is created by parsing a `PLSSDesc`, then `source` will be inherited from the parent `PLSSDesc`.  This can be useful for parsing numerous land descriptions (e.g., processing a large spreadsheet). It gets stored to the `.source` attribute (in both `PLSSDesc` and `Tract` objects).

4) `orig_desc`, `orig_index`, and `desc_is_flawed` are inherited by a `Tract` from a parent `PLSSDesc` object, if any. They *can* be set here, but there is probably not much reason for it.

5) If `twp` is passed as an int, or as a string that doesn't encode North/South (e.g., `'154'` instead of `'154n'`), it will fall back to what is specified in `default_ns` (if any), and if not there, then to `config=`. Similarly, if `rge` is passed as an int or as a string that doesn't encode East/West (e.g., `'97'` instead of `'97w'`), it will default to `default_ew` and then to `config=`. If not specified in any of those places, it will fall back to `PLSSDesc.MASTER_DEFAULT_NS` and `PLSSDesc.MASTER_DEFAULT_EW`, which are `'n'` and `'w'` unless changed by the user. 


### Populating lots/aliquots

If we want to populate the `lots`, `qqs`, `lots_qqs`, and `lot_acres` attributes of a `Tract` objects, we can trigger that in a number of ways:

1) If we instruct a `PLSSDesc` with `parse_qq=True` or `config='parse_qq'`, then the resulting `Tract` objects will be parsed into lots/QQs.

2) Call `parse()` on a `PLSSDesc` object with `parse_qq=True` to re-parse the `PLSSDesc` object itself, creating new `Tract` objects, which will also populate their lots/aliquots.

3) Call `.parse_tracts()` on an already-parsed `PLSSDesc` object to instruct its subordinate `Tract` objects to populate their lots/aliquots, *__without__* re-parsing the original `PLSSDesc` object itself (i.e. will *__not__* create new `Tract` objects).

4) Create a `Tract` object with `parse_qq=True` or `config='parse_qq'`.

5) Call `.parse()` on a `Tract` object.

*__Note:__* Control the size of the parsed aliquots with [`config=` parameters](https://github.com/JamesPImes/pyTRS/blob/master/guides/guides/config.md), specifically the [`qq_depth_min`, `qq_depth_max`, or `qq_depth` parameters](https://github.com/JamesPImes/pyTRS/blob/master/guides/guides/config.md#control-the-granularity-or-depth-of-aliquot-parsing-with-qq_depth-qq_depth_min-andor-qq_depth_max). By default, they are parsed into quarter-quarters (QQs), i.e. 40-acre divisions (e.g., `'W/2NE/4' -> ['NWNE', 'SWNE']`) -- but will also include smaller aliquot divisions if they exist in the description (e.g., `'E/2W/2NE/4' -> ['E2NWNE','E2SWNE']`).


### Setting Twp/Rge/Sec (`.trs` attribute, etc.)

Setting the `.trs` attribute of a `Tract` object will populate the other associated attributes accordingly (`.twp`, `.rge`, `.sec`, etc.) -- and it can be done either when created (`a_tract = pytrs.Tract("NE/4", trs='154n97w14')` or with [`Tract.from_twprgesec()`](https://github.com/JamesPImes/pyTRS/blob/master/guides/guides/tract.md#create-tract-objects-with-uncompiled-twprgesec-components-with-tractfrom_twprgesec), assigned directly afterwards (`a_tract.trs = '154n97w14'`) or with the `.set_twprgesec()` method:
```
# `trs` is not specified for this Tract.
a_tract = pytrs.Tract("NE/4")

a_tract.trs         # -> '___z___z__'  (an undefined Twp/Rge/Sec)
a_tract.twp         # -> '___z'
a_tract.twp_num     # -> None
# etc.


# Set `.trs` directly:
a_tract.trs = '154n97w14'

# Or equivalently, from the Twp/Rge/Sec components...
a_tract.set_twprgesec(twp=154, rge=97, sec=14, default_ns='n', default_ew='w')

# Or equivalently, do it when creating the Tract...
a_tract = pytrs.Tract("NE/4", trs="154n97w14")

# Or equivalently, created via `.from_twprgesec()`...
a_tract = Tract.from_twprgesec(
    desc="NE/4", twp=154, rge=97, sec=14, default_ns='n', default_ew='w')

# In any case:
a_tract.trs         # -> '154n97w14'
a_tract.twp         # -> '154n'
a_tract.twp_num     # -> 154 (an int)
a_tract.rge_ew      # -> 'w'
# etc.
```

Various Twp/Rge/Sec attributes *__other than__* `.trs` cannot be assigned directly. They may *__only__* be populated via one of the three methods above.
