## A primer on the PLSS (Land Descriptions)

The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) is how most of the land in the United States was surveyed and platted, from the late 1700s. Wikipedia provides a good primer on the Public Land Survey System (PLSS): <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System>

However, below is a very basic explanation of how the PLSS is commonly used by land professionals.

In the PLSS, land is divided into (mostly) square grids of land. (This is why land in so many parts of the country appears as squares when flying over it, and how highways manage to be so straight across much of the middle parts of the country.)

The main division of land is a "township", which typically consists of 36 squares, each numbered 1 - 36. Each of those 36 squares is a "section" and contains one square mile (or 640 acres). A typical township looks like this:

*A standard "Township" (36 square miles, broken down into 36 numbered sections)*

Townships are identified by:
-- a "Township" number and direction (north or south), AND
-- a "Range" number and direction (east or west).\*\*

\*\*__Note:__ The Range is further specified by its "principal meridian", often abbreviated "P.M." -- e.g., 'Township 154 North, Range 97 West, 5th P.M. *(In practice, the principal meridian is often omitted by land professionals, because they are so far apart that their omission leaves very little chance of ambiguity.)*

Thus, the asterisked section above would be described as follows:
`Section 14 of Township 154 North, Range 97 West, 5th P.M.`

Sometimes, land professionals who regularly deal with PLSS land descriptions will shorten this to "Sec. 14, T154N-R97W" or similar. Some who do data analysis will further shorten this to "154n97w14", which I refer to in shorthand as a "TRS" (literally, a 'Township-Range-Section' combintation).

As mentioned above, a standard PLSS "section" contains 1 square mile, or 640 acres. Each section is further divided literally into quarters, designated the Northwest Quarter (often shorthanded as "NW¼" or "NW1/4" or "NW/4"), the Northeast Quarter, the Southwest Quarter, and the Southeast Quarter:

*a standard "section" (1 square mile, or 640 acres)*

Thus, the asterisked quarter above (NW¼**) would be described as follows (containing approximately 160 acres, or 1/4 of a square mile):
> "The Northwest Quarter of Section 14, Township 154 North, Range 97 West, 5th P.M."


However, this will often appear on deeds, mortgages, rights-of-way, oil and gas leases, easements, etc. in the following format:
> Township 154 North, Range 97 West
> Section 14: NW¼

...or even as follows:
> T154N-R97W
> Sec 14: NW/4

There are any number of ways to *accurately* show this same tract of land.

A single land description may also cover multiple sections:
> Township 154 North, Range 97 West
> Section 14: NW¼
> Section 15: NE¼
> Section 9: SW¼, SE¼
	
This same can also be described as:
> "The NW/4 of Section 14, NE/4 of Section 15, SW/4 and SE/4 of Section 9, T154N-R97W"

Moreover, a land description is not limited to any particular length. It is common for land descriptions to contain very long "metes-and-bounds" descriptions (amounting to very verbose geometrical descriptions), such as the following example:
>	Township 154 North, Range 97 West, 5th P.M.
	Section 14: Lot 4, and a portion of the NE/4 being more particularly described as follows:
		Beginning at the Northeast corner of the NE/4, being the point of beginning;
		Thence running south along the east line of said Section 14 for 200 feet;
		Thence due west 100 feet;
		Thence due north, parallel with the east line of said Section 14 for 200ft, to the north line of the NE/4 of said Section 14;
		Thence due east 100ft to the point of beginning;
		Said tract containing 0.459137 acres, more or less

...which could nevertheless be parsed into the following:
    `trs` : `'154n97w14'`
    `desc`  :  `"""Lot 4, and a portion of the NE/4 being more particularly described as follows:\n
		Beginning at the Northeast corner of the NE/4, being the point of beginning;\n
		Thence running south along the east line of said Section 14 for 200 feet;\n
		Thence due west 100 feet;\n
		Thence due north, parallel with the east line of said Section 14 for 200ft, to the north line of the NE/4 of said Section 14;\n
		Thence due east 100ft to the point of beginning;\n
		Said tract containing 0.459137 acres, more or less"""`
